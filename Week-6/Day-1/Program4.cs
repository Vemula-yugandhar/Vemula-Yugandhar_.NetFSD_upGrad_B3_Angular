/*
Level-2 Problem 4: Asynchronous Order Processing System
Scenario:
 An e-commerce system processes customer orders. Each order requires multiple steps such as payment verification, inventory check, and order confirmation. These steps involve delays and should be handled asynchronously.
 
Requirements:
 - Create asynchronous methods:
   - VerifyPaymentAsync()
   - CheckInventoryAsync()
   - ConfirmOrderAsync()
 - Simulate processing delays using Task.Delay().
 - Execute steps asynchronously while maintaining the logical order of operations.
Technical Constraints:
 - Use async and await.
 - Use Task-based asynchronous methods.
 - Implement using a console application.
 
Expectations:
 - Each processing step should run asynchronously.
 - The program should display messages indicating the progress of order processing.
 
Learning Outcome:
 Students will understand how to design real-world workflows using asynchronous methods with async/await.
